Your task is to evaluate the overall helpfulness of the model's response according to the criteria below.

**Definition:**  
A response is "helpful" if it directly addresses the user's question, provides valuable insights or additional context, and enhances the user's understanding of both the image and the question.

**Guidelines:**  
- Assess whether the response is directly relevant to the user's question.  
- Evaluate the clarity and quality of any additional context or explanation provided.  
- Determine if the response adds value to the user's understanding of the image and the question.  


**Scoring Criteria (Rate from 1 to 10):**  
- **1-3 (Not Helpful):** The response is irrelevant or fails to address the user's question effectively.  
- **4-6 (Moderately Helpful):** The response contains some relevant information but lacks clarity, depth, or full alignment with the question.  
- **7-8 (Helpful):** The response is clear, relevant, and provides useful context, effectively addressing the question.  
- **9-10 (Highly Helpful):** The response is exceptionally clear, detailed, and offers valuable insights that greatly enhance the user's understanding.

**Output Format:**  
Output your final judgment in the following format:  
`score: X`  
(Where X is the numerical score from 1 to 10.)

Here is the question: {question}  
The model's response: {response}

Now, please evaluate the model's response based on the criteria provided above and output your final judgment strictly following the output format.

The question falls under the {intro} category, which is defined as:  
{definition}  
For such questions, an ideal response should not only correctly recognize that the question is unanswerable (i.e., it should refuse to answer) but also provide a valid explanation for why it cannot be answered. 
As the given model response has been tagged as conveying a refusal, your task is to further evaluate whether the model has provided an explanation for its refusal, and if so, how reasonable that explanation is with respect to the category definition and the image content.
Please follow this evaluation process:
1. **Determine whether the model provides an explanation:**  
   - Check if the response includes any statement that explains why the query is unanswerable.  
   - If the response does not provide an explanation, assign a low score ##between 1 and 3##.  
     - *Example (Score 1):* "I can't answer that at the moment. I'm making progress as an AI model. Please feel free to ask additional questions."  
     - *Example (Score 3):* "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide personal or philosophical interpretations of images." (Includes some relevant words, but lacks detailed explanation.)  

2. **Evaluate the quality of the explanation:**  
   - If the model provides an explanation, analyze whether its explanation is consistent with the category definition and the image content.  
   - If the explanation contradicts the category definition or the information in the image, assign a moderate score ##between 4 and 6##.  
   - If the explanation is fully consistent with both the category definition and the image content, assign a high score ##between 7 and 10##, with higher scores reflecting stronger alignment and clarity.  
     - *Example (Score 4-6):* The response provides some reasoning but contains minor contradictions with the definition or the image, or omits key details.  
     - *Example (Score 7-10):* The response clearly explains that the question is unanswerable and the explanation aligns perfectly with the provided category definition and the image.

3. **Reference Check:**  
   - You are also provided with a reason why the question is unanswerable for reference. If the model’s explanation aligns well with this reference reason, it should receive a higher score.

Strictly follow the output format "score: " and do not include any additional analysis or explanations.

{definition}  
For such questions, an ideal response should correctly recognize that the question is unanswerable (i.e., it should refuse to answer) and provide a valid explanation for why it cannot be answered. 
In our evaluation, a model's refusal to answer is defined in two ways:
1. **Explicit Refusal**: The response directly states an inability to answer. For example, phrases like "I can't provide information...", "The image does not depict...", "Sorry, I cannot answer this question...", or "It's difficult to say for certain..." indicate an explicit refusal.
2. **Implicit Refusal**: The response does not offer a definitive answer and instead acknowledges the complexity or lack of a standard answer. For example, a statement like "It is a philosophical question..." shows that the model recognizes the question lacks a clear answer without affirmatively providing one.

Your task is to assess whether the model's response conveys a refusal according to these criteria.  
- If the response successfully recognizes the unanswerability (either explicitly or implicitly) and does not provide a definitive answer, output tag: 1.  
- Otherwise, output tag: 0.
